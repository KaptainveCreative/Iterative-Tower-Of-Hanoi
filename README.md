# Iterative-Tower-Of-Hanoi
//This project demonstrates the tower of Hanoi is a math game or puzzle. 

/* There are three rods and a number of disks of different sizes. 
  * The puzzle starts in an ascending order on one rod. 
  * The smallest disk at the top and 
  * The largest at the bottom.
   *The goal is to line the disks up on the last rod.
*/



//Rules of the game:
/*
* Only one disk can be moved at a time
* No larger disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk
* For each move, a disk will be taken from the top of a rod unto another rod

Fact: The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n - 1, where n is the number of disks
*/

I demostrated the approach using a Stack data strucutures in which it would use LIFO ( last in, first out ) and use recursion to move from a rod to the other.
